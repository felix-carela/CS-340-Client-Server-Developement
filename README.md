## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I follow industry-standard best practices such as clear variable naming, modular programming, and thorough documentation. In my CRUD Python module from Project One, I used object-oriented programming to encapsulate the CRUD operations, making the code reusable and easier to maintain. This approach allowed me to easily connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two, ensuring a smooth integration. The advantage of this method is that it promotes code reusability and simplifies debugging and updates. In the future, this CRUD module can be used in other projects requiring database interactions, saving time and effort by not having to rewrite similar functionality.

## How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
As a computer scientist, I approach problems by first understanding the requirements and constraints, then breaking down the problem into manageable parts. For the Grazioso Salvare project, I started by understanding the data and the client's needs for the dashboard. I then created a plan that included setting up the database, developing the CRUD operations, and designing the interactive dashboard. This project required more integration and real-world application compared to previous assignments, which often focused on isolated skills or concepts. In the future, I will use a similar approach, combining requirements analysis, modular design, and iterative development to create efficient and scalable database solutions for clients.

## What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists solve complex problems by designing, implementing, and optimizing algorithms and systems. Their work matters because it drives innovation and efficiency in various fields. On this project, my work helps Grazioso Salvare by providing a streamlined way to identify and categorize dogs for search-and-rescue training. The dashboard allows users to interact with the data dynamically, making it easier to make informed decisions. This type of project enhances the company's ability to manage their operations effectively, ultimately contributing to their mission of training rescue dogs and saving lives.
